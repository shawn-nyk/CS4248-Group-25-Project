imdb sentimental analysis

This is CS4248 Group 25â€™s code repository. For our project, our team worked on the sentiment analysis of IMDb movie reviews using RNNs. This repo contains all the code we used and findings we referenced in our report, which consists of data preprocessing as well as recursive neural network (RNN) models. The dataset that was used can be found here: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
